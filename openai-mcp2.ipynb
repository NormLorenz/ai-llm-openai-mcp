It first connects to the local FastMCP server to retrieve the tools it exposes (like weather forecast and alerts). These tools are then used to create an OpenAI agent. Finally, the agent is run with a user input, and it leverages the provided FastMCP tools to find the answer, in this case, asking about the weather in Seattle."
